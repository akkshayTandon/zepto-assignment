# Zepto Assignment
 This was made as a part of the assignment given by Zepto for the Frontend SDE 1 position.

## Problem Statement

 #### Specifications
   1. When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.
   2. As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.
   3. Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.
   4. Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
   5. Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

 #### Bonus Task
   1. Clean code.
   2. TypeScript.
   3. When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted.

 #### Notes
   1. Make sure you code your solution in React (CRA/NextJS).
   2. Make sure you build the component from scratch and do not use any component based library like MUI, Chakra UI etc.
   3. You are free to use CSS solutions like TailwindCss/SCSS.

## Solution

  #### Tech Stack Used

  - [x] Built using React + plain CSS.
  - [x] No component libraries used.

  #### Achieved Functionalities

  - [x] A list of items appear on clicking the input field.
  - [x] As you type, the list show only the items that   match what you're typing.
  - [x] Clicking on an item turns it into a chip, the input field becomes empty.
  - [x] The items gets removed from the list.
  - [x] Clicking the "X" icon, removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.

  #### Not Achieved

  - [ ] Clicking on the item converts it into a chip but it does not adds it in the input field. Instead a new list is formed below it.
  - [ ] No Typescript.
  - [ ] Not Responsive in terms of UI.
  - [ ] When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted.
